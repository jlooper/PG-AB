Personally I'd remove the “What's the Difference?” heading, as I think the opening description can stand on its own without a heading. -->

                    <p class="text">PhoneGap is a distribution of Apache Cordova. Cordova powers PhoneGap, just like WebKit powers Chrome and Safari. AppBuilder is a platform that supports Cordova APIs and enables many different ways of building and distributing apps. Both PhoneGap and AppBuilder feature the integration of Cordova plugins like the accelerometer, camera, compass or the file system to access cross-platform native functionality. You also can use community-built Cordova custom plugins for added functionality such as bar code scanners and iBeacon readers. You can build great hybrid mobile apps using any of these tools. This site, built by members of the Developer Relations team at Telerik, is designed to help you differentiate between them.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">When enabled in PhoneGap Build, "hydration" is available to PhoneGap app developers. Using Hydration, updates are pushed directly to the application installed on a device. Once a developer uploads a new build the end user of the application will be notified when restarting the application. Using the PhoneGap App, syncing occurs over wireless connections when you pair your computer to the installed app, which acts as a container for your app.</p>

When you deploy your application on connected physical or virtual devices, you can refresh your changes automatically by saving your changes. When you deploy your application in the AppBuilder Companion App on remote devices, you can refresh your changes by tapping and holding three fingers.</p>

<!-- If I understand hydration correctly (which I'm not sure I do) it's not so much a development tool as much as it is a testing tool. Their docs even say that “Once a developer upload a new build the end user (e.g. tester)...”. When I tried Hydration a year or so ago I remember not being impressed.

LiveSync is a much more powerful tool because it lets you update apps without closing them and reopening them. With the CLI you can set the --watch flag to make your app work like LiveReload. But despite LiveSync being far more powerful, at a glance, this section makes PhoneGap seem like they have a better solution because they have more check boxes. I'm not sure Hydration can do all of those things, and I'd add a few categories to cover some of the things LiveSync can do and PhoneGap can't— for instance a CLI-based watcher, managing which files can be LiveSync'd (with .abignore), a gesture to trigger the refresh, etc. -->

                        <p class="text-muted">There are several ways to test an app's behavior. By typing 'phonegap emulate ios' in the command line you can see how your app looks on an iOS simulator, and similarly for Android emulators. PhoneGap Build offers a quick way to download builds for testing on a device, but you do need to include provisioning profiles for your iOS testers. The new PhoneGap app allows wireless emulation. Also available is an emulation service where you can enter a url and use Chrome's developer tools to debug. This emulation requires the Chrome browser and the Ripple emulation extension to be installed. Alternately, simply using Chrome's Dev Tools with the Device Emulation extension installed helps considerably to test your app. For on-device debugging you can make use of Safari's Developer Tools to debug remote code for iOS apps. For other devices, you can also use Weinre to get an idea of bugs that occur on a device. Finally, you can always use native development tools such as Xcode's console and Android's 'adb' toolset to debug.</p>

You can view an app's behavior using AppBuilder's built-in simulators or emulate the app using native simulators associated with Android, Windows Phone, and Xcode. In addition, when you're ready to test on device, AppBuilder offers the Companion App, a way for you to test your app on a device without provisioning, which eases iOS development in particular. AppBuilder includes several options for debugging your app in a browser. You can use built-in developer tools to check JavaScript performance by inspecting the code in a browser on your local machine. Similar to PhoneGap, you can debug your app using Chrome or Safari developer tools or native software solutions. In addition, AppBuilder offers a suite of sophisticated testing tools. The new Test Portal allows you to write JavaScript test scripts and run them on devices in the cloud, greatly expanding the number of virtual devices on which to test apps.</p>

<!-- Overall I found this section really hard to follow as there is a lot of text for both PhoneGap and AppBuilder. Consider using bulleted lists, or multiple paragraphs to make this section more digestible. Each of the tools that you mention should have links so people can do further research, as you only (rightly) give a brief explanation here. Rob has a few articles on TDN that talk running AppBuilder apps on the native emulators for instance. -->

<!-- Device cloud is a feature of the Platform and not AppBuilder. I would omit this here because of that. You might want to have an “integration” section where you can talk about the Platform and maybe PhoneGap Enterprise. -->

<!-- Our simulator is far superior to Ripple and I feel like that needs to be more immediately apparent here. -->

<!-- PhoneGap has their Developer App that works pretty much exactly like our Companion App, and I don't believe you mention PhoneGap's app here. -->

    <!-- This is a great start. I'm trying to think of other things to add. One would be plugins, as PhoneGap has https://build.phonegap.com/plugins and we have our marketplace. Our plugin marketplace and the tools we offer to manage plugins is probably our single biggest competitive advantage at this point.

    Another good section might be integrations (or some name like that), as the Telerik Platform should be included somewhere in this guide. AppManager, the device cloud, AppFeedback, Backend Services, Analytics, etc. We have a much better story to tell there.

    Let's see... what else.... AppBuilder has a lot of good sample apps. AppBuilder has a lot of little helpful things (all the stuff on .abproject) that you get a nice interface to manage, instead of dealing with arcane configuration files like you do with PhoneGap. Our docs are far more comprehensive.

    In general my feedback would be to include a lot more links and pictures. You're not going to be able to provide in-depth explanations of everything, so I think this guide is most helpful as a starting point for someone's research. We have a lot of good content out there and we should leverage it. -->
